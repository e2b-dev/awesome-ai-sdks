# :mag_right: Products allowing to choose your own LLM

## [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
AutoGen is a framework by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat/) that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve task


<details>

### Description
-  AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation
-  They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools
-  AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages:
	- it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs
  	- it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents
     	- it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats

## [Agents](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents)

**Agents** is an open-source library/framework for building autonomous language agents.

<details>

### Description
-   **Long-short Term Memory**: Language agents in the library are equipped with both long-term memory implemented via VectorDB + Semantic Search and short-term memory (working memory) maintained and updated by an LLM.
-   **Tool Usage**: Language agents in the library can use any external tools via  [function-calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)  and developers can add customized tools/APIs  [here](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents/blob/master/src/agents/Component/ToolComponent.py).
-   **Web Navigation**: Language agents in the library can use search engines to navigate the web and get useful information.
-   **Multi-agent Communication**: In addition to single language agents, the library supports building multi-agent systems in which language agents can communicate with other language agents and the environment. Different from most existing frameworks for multi-agent systems that use pre-defined rules to control the order for agents' action,  **Agents**  includes a  _controller_  function that dynamically decides which agent will perform the next action using an LLM by considering the previous actions, the environment, and the target of the current states. This makes multi-agent communication more flexible.
-   **Human-Agent interaction**: In addition to letting language agents communicate with each other in an environment, our framework seamlessly supports human users to play the role of the agent by himself/herself and input his/her own actions, and interact with other language agents in the environment.
-   **Symbolic Control**: Different from existing frameworks for language agents that only use a simple task description to control the entire multi-agent system over the whole task completion process,  **Agents**  allows users to use an  **SOP (Standard Operation Process)**  that defines subgoals/subtasks for the overall task to customize fine-grained workflows for the language agents.

## [Langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid)

Multi-Agent framework for building LLM Applications.

<details>

### Description


`Langroid` is an intuitive, lightweight, extensible and principled
Python framework to easily build LLM-powered applications.
You set up Agents, equip them with optional components (LLM,
vector-store and methods), assign them tasks, and have them
collaboratively solve a problem by exchanging messages.
This Multi-Agent paradigm is inspired by the
[Actor Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
(but you do not need to know anything about this!).

`Langroid` is a fresh take on LLM app-development, where considerable thought has gone
into simplifying the developer experience; it does not use `Langchain`.

- Works with most commercial/remote and open/local LLMs.
- Set up Multi-agent, multi-LLM system: use stronger LLMs for agents requiring strong reasoning and instruction-following, and delegate simpler tasks to weaker/local LLMs. 
- Supports OpenAI function-calling as well as native equivalent called `ToolMessage`, which works with LLMs that 
  do not have built-in function-calling. Simply specify structure as a (nested) Pydantic object.
- Batteries-included: vector-databases for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), caching, logging/observability.
- Specialized agents available: `DocChatAgent`, `SQLChatAgent`, `TableChatAgent` (for tabular data, e.g. csv/dataframes).
- `DocChatAgent` handles text, PDF, Docx files/URLS, and has state-of-the art techniques 
   for retrieval combining lexical and semantic search.
- Documentation: https://langroid.github.io/langroid/
